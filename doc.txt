What Is Angular?
Angular is an open-source, JavaScript framework written in TypeScript. Google maintains it, and its primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. As a framework, Angular has clear advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables users to create large applications in a maintainable manner. 

What is component in Angular?
In Angular, a component is the most basic building block of an Angular application. It is a self-contained piece of code that has its own template, style, and logic. Components are responsible for rendering the content and handling user interactions with the view.
Components are declared using the @Component decorator, which takes a metadata object as its argument. The metadata object specifies the component's selector, template, style, and other properties.
The template is an HTML file that defines the component's view. The style is a CSS file that defines the component's styles. The logic is written in a TypeScript class that is associated with the component.
Components can be nested within other components to create complex UIs.

What is template in Angular?
A template is a form of HTML that tells Angular how to render the component. Views are typically organized hierarchically, allowing you to modify or show and hide entire UI sections or pages as a unit. The template immediately associated with a component defines that component's host view.
