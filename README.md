# Angular Learning Repository ⚡

Welcome to my **Angular Learning Repo**!  
This is where I practice **Angular concepts**, explore features, and build small projects while learning.  
Over time, I’ll keep adding more examples and apps as I improve.

- 📈 Future projects as I go deeper into Angular  

## 🚀 Goals
- Strengthen understanding of **core Angular concepts**  
- Learn to build **modular and scalable apps**  
- Gain hands-on experience with **real-world Angular projects**  

## ✅ Progress
- ✔️ Practicing core Angular fundamentals
